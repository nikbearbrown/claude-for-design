# Chapter 2 — No Clear Hierarchy


## TL;DR

- When the eye doesn't know where to land first, the slide has already failed — what is it that makes hierarchy visible, and what destroys it?
- The chapter moves through What the eye is actually doing, Size: the ratio that actually works, Weight: the one-emphasis rule, Proximity: the grouping the eye trusts, and related ideas.
- Read it for the main argument, the vocabulary it introduces, and the practical judgment it asks you to develop.

*When the eye doesn't know where to land first, the slide has already failed — what is it that makes hierarchy visible, and what destroys it?*

---

Here is a thing that happens to almost everyone who makes slides for the first time.

You put a title at the top. You put some bullets underneath. The title is a little bigger than the bullets — you can see that it's bigger, if you look carefully. Then you add a callout box on the right because there's a fact you want to highlight. You bold the callout heading so it stands out. You color two of the bullets because the colors feel right and the slide looks a little plain without them.

You look at the finished slide. It seems fine. Everything is on there.

Then you show it to someone. You watch their eyes. They glance at the callout. Then the colored bullets. Then back to the callout. Then — eventually — they read the title. They have toured your slide in the wrong order, and they have left with the wrong thing in their head, and the troubling part is that nothing on the slide was an accident. Every element was placed with intention. The hierarchy was there. It was just the wrong hierarchy.

That's the puzzle I want to think through with you in this chapter. Not *does hierarchy matter* — it obviously does — but *what, exactly, produces it?* Because there are really only three forces doing the work, and once you see them, you can diagnose any slide failure in about ten seconds.

---

## What the eye is actually doing

When you look at a slide for the first time, you are not reading. You are scanning.

The visual system is extraordinarily fast at certain things and extraordinarily slow at others. It is fast at detecting contrast — differences in size, weight, brightness, color. It is slow at parsing meaning. Reading a sentence takes hundreds of milliseconds per word. Detecting that one element is bigger than another takes somewhere around fifty milliseconds total.

This is not a metaphor. It is how the visual cortex works: the magnocellular pathway handles coarse spatial information fast; the parvocellular pathway handles fine detail and color more slowly. The practical consequence is that the first thing the eye does on a slide is not find the title — it finds the highest-contrast element, whatever that is. If the highest-contrast element is your "Did you know?" callout box, that's where the eye goes first. The title can be labeled *title* in your mind all it wants; the visual system doesn't read labels.

*Figure 2.1 — Simplified schematic of the visual pathway from retina*

So hierarchy on a slide is not what you intend. It is what the contrast gradients say.

The three forces that produce contrast gradients are: **size**, **weight**, and **proximity**. Size and weight work on individual elements — they make one thing look more important than another. Proximity works on groups — it makes things that belong together look like they belong together. Everything else (color, texture, borders, white space) is downstream of these three. You can do a lot of visual design damage with color, but you can't fix a broken hierarchy with it.

## Size: the ratio that actually works

Size is the most intuitive of the three. Bigger means more important. This is correct, but incomplete. The relevant question is not *is the title bigger* but *how much bigger*, and at what distance.

Here is a fact that surprises most people: a title at 32 points above body text at 28 points is not a visible hierarchy at projection distance. The ratio — 32 to 28, roughly 1.14 — is below the threshold at which the visual system reads two elements as belonging to different levels. In normal reading conditions you might perceive the difference. In a lecture hall at fifteen feet, with the screen at an angle, under variable lighting, the two elements read as one block. The slide has a hierarchy in the file; it does not have a hierarchy in the room.

The ratio that reliably works at projection distance is around 2:1. A title at 44 points and body text at 22 points. This feels extreme when you look at it on your laptop at arm's length. It feels correct to the person in the back row.

Robert Bringhurst, who has thought about typography more carefully than almost anyone, organizes his thinking around *modular scales* — sequences of sizes related by a consistent ratio. The ratios he names as useful are 1.125, 1.2, 1.25, 1.333, 1.5, 1.618, and 2. The small ones — 1.125, 1.2 — are for book typography, where the reader is close and the contrast accumulates across a full page of variation. The large ones are for display typography, where the contrast has to survive distance and angle and imperfect conditions. A projected slide is display typography. Use the large ratios.

| Ratio | Context | example sizes (body at 22pt) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bringhurst's modular scale ratios | two | Use the chapter example as the concrete test case. |

There is an important corollary: if you have three type sizes on your slide, each of them has to be doing identifiable work. Not *slightly different for visual interest*, but *this size means this level of the hierarchy, full stop*. If you cannot name what each size is for, you probably have too many sizes and the eye cannot parse the system. Two sizes — title and body, 2:1 ratio — forces the question.

---

## Weight: the one-emphasis rule

Weight is what bold does. And bold does something specific: it says *this is more important than the surrounding text*.

The thing about emphasis is that it works by contrast. A word in bold in a paragraph of regular text pops forward. A paragraph in bold in a slide of bold text is just... the normal weight. The emphasis has cancelled itself out.

This sounds obvious when stated plainly. But look at almost any AI-generated slide deck and you will find the body text in semibold, the bullet points in semibold, the subheadings in bold, and the title in bold — a slide with four or five elements all fighting for visual primacy with weight, none winning. The slide is uniformly tense. The eye has nowhere to rest and nothing to prioritize.

The rule that fixes this: **emphasis appears at most twice on a slide, and only on elements that the slide's main claim specifically names as important**. Not twice as a ceiling you should try to reach. Twice as the absolute maximum, and once is usually better.

This is what Richard Feynman called *using judgment* — not a formula that you apply mechanically, but a question you ask every time. Before you bold something, ask: what am I saying this matters more than? If the answer is *everything else on the slide*, then one bolded element creates the hierarchy. If the answer is *another bolded element*, then neither one wins and you've spent both your emphasis tokens.

There is a version of this failure that arrives through color. A slide with three bullets, two of them in accent colors — one purple, one green — is a slide with two emphasis signals and no signal about what the colors mean. The eye sees: *these two are different from the third*. It cannot see *why* they are different, because the slide has not said. This is Mayer's Signaling Principle inverted: a cue is present, but the cue is answering a question the slide never asked. The color is spending visual bandwidth on nothing.

Compare: a slide with three bullets, one of them in bold red, whose headline says *the second cause was load-bearing*. Now the color is answering the headline's question. The signal is spending its bandwidth on the slide's central claim. One cue, one purpose, visible at a glance.

![Emphasis works by scarcity. Spend it twice arbitrarily and it means nothing. Spend it once on what the headline names and it does all the pointing.](images/02-no-clear-hierarchy-fig-03.png)
*Figure 2.3 — Slide mockups illustrating the color-encoding failure and fix*

## Proximity: the grouping the eye trusts

Size and weight work on how important something looks. Proximity works on what belongs with what.

The perceptual principle here was named by the Gestalt psychologists — Max Wertheimer in 1923, followed by Köhler and Koffka — and every vision science textbook since has confirmed it: elements that are spatially close are read as a group, regardless of what they are. The eye does this before meaning is processed. A bulleted list where all the bullets sit tightly together reads as one group; a loose collection of text elements scattered around a slide reads as — well, it doesn't read as anything coherent, because grouping by proximity is what makes structure visible.

The practical consequence is that **white space is not decoration — it is syntax**. The gap between your title and your body text is asserting a relationship: *these are different groups*. The gap between your bullet group and your callout box is asserting a relationship: *these do not belong to the same idea*. If you tighten or loosen those gaps for aesthetic reasons, you are changing the semantic claims the slide is making, whether you mean to or not.

![White space is not padding — it is punctuation. The gap is making a claim about what belongs together.](images/02-no-clear-hierarchy-fig-04.png)
*Figure 2.4 — The same six slide elements shown twice in*

Here is the grouping error that produces the most common hierarchy failure: a callout box on the side of a slide, with its own bold heading and a border, sitting at roughly the same height as the slide's main title. The visual system sees: *the title and the callout heading are both emphasized, both at eye level, both making claims*. It cannot tell which is primary. The callout wins if its visual weight is higher than the title's — and it often is, because someone bolded the callout heading heavily to make it "stand out," and heavier weight beats title size when the size ratio is already thin.

The fix is not to make the callout look less important. The fix is to ask what the callout is for. If it carries supporting detail that the live-deck audience doesn't need during the lecture, it belongs in the notes field. If it carries a fact the slide's argument depends on, it belongs in the body, not in a box that competes with the claim. The box is a design solution in search of a problem, and the problem it usually creates is a hierarchy fight it was never supposed to be in.

## What hierarchy is really for

I want to pause on something that the framework vocabulary can obscure.

The reason hierarchy matters is not aesthetic. It is not that cluttered slides are ugly and minimal slides are beautiful. The reason is that your audience is doing cognitive work while looking at the slide — they are simultaneously reading, listening to you, and trying to connect what they're seeing to what they already know. Working memory is finite. Every time the eye lands in the wrong place, or has to scan the slide twice to find the entry point, or tries to parse a color that doesn't mean anything — that's cognitive work spent on your design instead of your content.

Cognitive load theory, developed by John Sweller in the late 1980s, distinguishes between intrinsic load (the complexity of the content itself), extraneous load (the cognitive cost imposed by the design of the material), and germane load (the cognitive work of actually learning). The job of a well-designed slide is to minimize extraneous load so that the available cognitive capacity goes to the content. A hierarchy failure is an extraneous load generator. Every ambiguous emphasis decision, every misused color, every poorly spaced group — each one is a small tax on the student's attention.

![A hierarchy failure doesn't make the content harder. It fills the wrong bucket and leaves less capacity for learning.](images/02-no-clear-hierarchy-fig-05.png)
*Figure 2.5 — Three-bucket diagram of Sweller's cognitive load model *

This is why the one-second test matters so much. Ask someone to glance at your slide for one second and tell you what they read. What they report is what your hierarchy says is most important. If their answer matches your intention, the hierarchy is working. If it doesn't — if they report the callout trivia while you intended the main claim — then the hierarchy is lying about the content, and students will learn the wrong thing, or learn nothing, not because the content was hard but because the slide's visual structure sent them to the wrong place first.

---

## A concrete example

Let me show you the same slide in both configurations, because the principle is easier to see than to describe.

The bad version starts with a title: "Three Causes of the 2008 Financial Crisis." Not wrong, but not a claim — a label. The bullets below it are at 28pt semibold, the title is 32pt semibold. Ratio: 1.14×. At projection distance: invisible. One bullet is purple. Another is green. There is a callout box titled "Did you know?" in bold, heavier than the main title. The callout says Lehman Brothers was founded in 1850.

Run the one-second test: the eye finds "Did you know?" first, because it is the heaviest element on the slide. The student who glances up for a second leaves knowing something about 1850. The slide's actual subject — which of the three causes was the structural one — is not communicated at all.

Now the good version. Title: "MBS leverage was the load-bearing cause." Full sentence. A claim, not a label. At 44pt bold, with body text at 22pt regular — ratio 2:1. The three bullets are all at 22pt regular, except the middle one: "Mortgage-backed security leverage" in bold with a red accent. One emphasis, on the bullet the headline names. The callout is gone; its 1850 fact is in the notes field.

![Same content. Same facts. The left slide teaches 1850. The right slide teaches which cause was structural.](images/02-no-clear-hierarchy-fig-06.png)
*Figure 2.6 — Side-by-side mockup of the two 2008 financial crisis*

One-second test: the eye finds the title, reads a claim, looks for evidence, finds one emphasized bullet confirming the claim. The student who glances up for a second has the answer. The hierarchy is doing what hierarchy is supposed to do — it is pointing.

The biggest change between the two versions was not the size ratio. It was deciding what the title was *for*. Once the title became a claim rather than a label, the questions answered themselves. Which bullet should be emphasized? The one the claim names. What should the color encode? The same thing. The visual hierarchy followed from the rhetorical hierarchy, because that's what visual hierarchy is — the rhetorical structure made visible at the speed of perception.

## The prompt

If you are using an AI slide tool and want to fix a hierarchy problem, here is the prompt that addresses the root cause rather than the symptom:

```
Restructure this slide so the visual hierarchy is unmistakable at a
glance. Requirements:

1. The headline is the entry point. Set it at 44pt bold (or whatever
   produces at least a 2.0x size ratio against body text). Rewrite the
   headline as a full-sentence claim if it is currently a topic label.

2. Body text sits at one weight lighter than the headline (regular,
   not bold) and at body size from DESIGN.md. There should be exactly
   two type sizes on this slide: headline and body. Reject any
   intermediate sizes.

3. Accent color appears at most twice on the slide and only on elements
   the headline's claim points to. If you cannot state in one phrase
   what the accent color encodes on this slide, remove the color.

4. Group elements by proximity. Things that belong together sit
   together with tight spacing; groups are separated by visible
   whitespace at least 1.5x the line-height between groups.

5. Move any callout box, sidebar, or "did you know" element to the
   notes field unless the headline's claim explicitly depends on it.

Return the slide as Brutalist HTML with the .slide and .notes structure
preserved.
```

The second requirement is the one that gets resisted most: *but I need three sizes for nuance*. Three sizes is fine when each size does identifiable work. Three sizes that the eye reads as one band — because the ratios are all below 1.5× — is not three sizes; it is visual noise that looks like structure.

---

## Two honest disagreements

Before leaving this chapter, I want to name where two thoughtful people can read everything above and still disagree. Not because one is wrong, but because they are optimizing for different things.

The first disagreement is about how aggressive the contrast should be. Reynolds-style slide design — which is close to what I've described here — uses dramatic ratios (2× or higher), one or two type weights, and generous white space. The argument for it is that hierarchy invisible to the back row is hierarchy that didn't happen. But Tufte-style technical typography accepts subtler hierarchy: 1.5× ratios, multiple weights, small caps, indentation as a hierarchy cue. The argument for that approach is that dense technical content cannot be flattened to keynote sparseness without lying about the structure. Both are right in their domains. Reynolds' approach is for the lecture hall. Tufte's approach is for the journal page. A projected slide is closer to the lecture hall than the journal page, which is why this book leans toward 2.0× as the default — but if you are projecting a dense technical diagram to specialists who expect to study it closely, the subtler approach may serve better. The vocabulary to use when making this choice: *what is the contrast ratio between my levels, and does the person in the back row see it?* Not *which aesthetic do I prefer?*

The second disagreement is about how many type sizes a slide can carry. I've argued for two. A designed system — light for captions, regular for body, semibold for sub-emphasis, bold for headline — can work if each level does identifiable work and the system is applied consistently across every slide in the deck. The failure mode is not four sizes; it is four sizes used inconsistently, so the eye cannot learn the system and has to re-parse each slide from scratch. If you use four sizes, name what each one means, and hold to it every time.

| Dimension | Reynolds | presentation style | Tufte | technical style |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| typical size ratio, number of weights used, white space approach, best context, failure mode when misapplied | The pattern becomes easy to misuse or overlook. | A concrete checkpoint for applying the chapter concept. | A concrete checkpoint for applying the chapter concept. | A concrete checkpoint for applying the chapter concept. |

---

## The diagnostic questions

Five questions, ten seconds. Run any slide through them before it ships.

Where did your eye land first? If it didn't land on the most important element, the hierarchy is wrong.

How many type sizes are on this slide, and can you name what each one is for? More than three, or any you can't name — those are accidental sizes.

What does the accent color encode? If you can't answer in one phrase, the color is decoration and should come off.

Are elements that belong together physically close? Proximity is making a claim; make sure it's the claim you want.

If you removed all the text and looked only at the shapes and weight, would you still see the structure? Hierarchy that survives that test is doing visible work.

---

Once the hierarchy is clear, the next problem is different: the slide may have the right structure and still carry too much. Chapter 3 is about that — the decision of what to cut, and what happens to the cut material when it doesn't go in the trash but has somewhere else to go.

---

**What would change my mind:** A controlled study showing that subtle typographic hierarchy (1.2× ratios, multiple weights) produces equivalent recall and comprehension to dramatic hierarchy (2×+ ratios, two weights) for projected lecture slides in actual classroom conditions. The literature supports the Signaling Principle generally but does not finely partition by hierarchy-aggression. If evidence arrives on the subtle-hierarchy side, the default ratio in this chapter should be revised downward.

**Still puzzling:** I do not have a clean rule for when an intermediate type size earns its place. Two sizes plus careful weight variation handles almost every slide I've seen. The case for a third size — a sub-headline, a caption tier — is intuitively real, but the empirical work isolating its value against the cost in visual complexity is, to my reading, thin.

---

### LLM Exercises

**Exercise 1 — Hierarchy audit**
Paste any slide you have built recently into an LLM with this prompt: *"Look at this slide. Without reading its content, describe where my eye would land first, second, and third. Then tell me whether that order matches a coherent hierarchy from most to least important."* Compare the LLM's reading order to your intended reading order. Where they diverge, diagnose which of the three forces — size, weight, or proximity — is producing the mismatch.

**Exercise 2 — The ratio check**
Take a slide where the hierarchy feels weak. Ask an LLM: *"The title of this slide is [N]pt bold. The body text is [M]pt semibold. Given that the slide will be projected in a lecture hall, is this ratio sufficient for the eye to parse title and body as different hierarchy levels? What ratio would you recommend, and why?"* Then apply the recommendation and run the one-second test on a colleague.

**Exercise 3 — Color encoding**
Find a slide in your current deck that uses accent colors on more than one element. Paste it to an LLM with this prompt: *"List every element on this slide that is colored, bolded, or otherwise visually emphasized. For each one, state in a single phrase what the emphasis is encoding — what question it is answering. If you cannot state a purpose, flag it."* Use the flagged items to decide what comes off the slide.

**Exercise 4 — Callout surgery**
Take a slide with a callout box, sidebar, or bordered "did you know" element. Ask an LLM: *"The headline of this slide claims [X]. The callout box contains [Y]. Evaluate: does the callout support the headline's claim directly enough to stay on the live-deck slide, or does it belong in the notes field? Explain the hierarchy fight the callout is creating and what resolves it."*

**Exercise 5 — Rebuild from claim**
Give an LLM a topic-label title and a set of bullets: *"Rewrite this slide so the title is a full-sentence claim that identifies the most important bullet. Then restructure the bullets so the one the title names is visually distinct (bold, accent color, or both) and the others are regular weight. Use a 2:1 size ratio between title and body. Return the result as plain text with formatting described in brackets."* Compare the rebuilt slide against the original and name what changed in the hierarchy and why.
